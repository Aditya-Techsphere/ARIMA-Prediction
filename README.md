# Algorithmic Trading Strategy with ARIMA Predictions
This Python script presents an algorithmic trading strategy designed to make informed decisions based on historical stock price data. The strategy incorporates technical indicators, such as the Simple Moving Average (SMA), and leverages the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for predicting stock prices.

# Project Type: Minor Project Using Kaggle Data

Technical Indicators: Utilizes the SMA to identify trends and potential entry/exit points in the stock market.
ARIMA Predictions: Implements the ARIMA model to forecast stock prices, aiding in decision-making for trading strategies.
Backtesting Strategy: Evaluates the effectiveness of the trading strategy by backtesting against historical data.
Visualizations: Provides visual representations, including bar charts for cumulative returns and line charts illustrating Buy/Sell signals.

## How to Use

[1] Clone or Download: 

Clone the repository or download the Python script (algorithmic_trading_arima.py).

[2] Prepare Dataset: 

Place your historical stock price dataset in CSV format and specify the file path in the script.

--python--
file_path = '/path/to/your/stock_data.csv'

[3]Run the Script: Execute the script using the command:

--bash--
python ARIMA.py

Explore Results: View the printed stock data, including SMA, trading signals, ARIMA predictions, and Buy/Sell signals.**

## Strategy Steps
Data Loading: Load historical stock price data from a specified CSV file.
Technical Indicators: Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) to identify trends.

## Trading Signals: 
Generate signals based on SMA:
--Buy signal when the closing price is above the SMA.
--Sell signal when the closing price is below the SMA.
--ARIMA Predictions: Apply the ARIMA model to forecast stock prices.

## Backtesting: 
Evaluate the trading strategy using ARIMA predictions:
Determine Buy (1), Sell (-1), or Hold (0) positions.
Calculate cumulative returns for the strategy and market.
Visualizations: Plot bar charts for cumulative returns and line charts for closing prices with Buy/Sell signals.

## Notes
Adjustable Parameters: Modify the ARIMA order and other parameters to suit your specific dataset.
Customization: Feel free to customize the script to explore additional features for your unique trading strategy.
